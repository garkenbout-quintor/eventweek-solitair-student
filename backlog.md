# Product Backlog

This is your **Product Backlog**, a list of items for your project to succeed. You will be practising test driven developement.
The good news is that test cases have been written for you. To be able to complete this project all you need to do is pass the 
existing tests. There is a order which implementations to write. This backlog is prioritized to this test order.
Not all task are in the backlog only the most significant ones. It's up for the team to add the other tasks based
on the work your team sees.

# Sprint 0
Before jumping into the code it's a good practice to start with a sprint 0. In sprint 0 you
make sure that you **all** have a working environment to work in. Make sure your team is ready
before working on the backlog as stated above. Subjects you need to think about are:
- All tools are working on each laptop
    - Java JDK 8
    - Maven
    - A IDE 
    - Git 
- Versioning is in place and the team has been thinking about a branching strategy
- The team has made appointments about how to work (Like for example pair programming)
